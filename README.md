# catTamagotchi

A cat-plant tamagotchi that lives in the local storage of your computed. Inspired by "How to grow a cat" risograph manual. The cat gets hungry every 5 hours, needs to be shown love every 7.5 hours and has to go to the vet every 12 hours, otherwise it will get sick and die after 10 more hours. After 30 days it will be fully grown and live up to an age of 365 days if cared for regularly.
